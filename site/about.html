Amanda Carter, aka <i>Misses Ellipsis</i> is a singer-songwriter, composer and multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles who has lived in several cities across the U.S. Her music is eclectic and reflects her love of great songs across time. Growing from seeds of jazz, soul, rock, folk, showtunes and film music, Misses Ellipses is a hunt for the magical power of a song to tell a compelling story and reveal moods and ideas shrouded in mystery. 

<p>
Amanda is currently studying experimental music at California Institute of the Arts.
